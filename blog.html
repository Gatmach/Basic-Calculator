    <!-- <div> -->
    <!-- <p>I was born on October 27, 1998, in a small remote village known as Wecgau, located in Nyirol county in South Sudan.
        <br> I am a Nuer of the Lou clan, living in Jonglei State. My parents' names are Yuol Nyuon and Nyaboth Puok. 
        <br>Life has not been fair to us back in South Sudan.
        <br>When I was just about two years old, our cattle were raided by Raiders from the Murle tribe.
        <br> They took all our cattle and left us with nothing. Coping with the situation was tough due to the lack of milk to feed on because all cattle were stolen. 
        <br>A few months later, our village was also attacked by very dangerous pandemics such as malaria and cholera. 
        <br>These diseases killed approximately 30 per cent of the entire population, most of them being very little children who died due to the lack of hospitals where those diseases could be diagnosed.
        <br> Luckily enough, I managed to survive.</p>
    <p>We moved on with life for a year before another horrible tragedy happened. 
        <br>My dear mother passed away during the day she was giving birth to my sibling. 
        <br>It was very painful and heartbreaking to lose my mum at an earlier age when I needed her most. 
        <br>I cried and wept for almost a week mourning the death of my mother. 
        <br>I thought that it was the end of my world. What was most painful is that even my sibling could not be saved, just like my mum. 
        <br>As I grew up, I kept on thinking about what I would do to prevent what happened to my mother. 
        <br>I swore to myself that one day I would build a very large hospital where every person with a serious disease could be diagnosed for free.
        <br>In 2003, I attained the age of starting school but unfortunately, I could not join the school because our village had no school constructed for formal education.
        <br> The only education I could access at that time was just informal education. 
        <br>I was taught how to herd cattle, sheep, and goats. About two weeks later, I started taking our cattle to grazing fields and water points, which were about eight miles from home. 
        <br>Imagine that quite long distances could be covered by a very little child every day. 
        <br>Life ran smoothly for a few months.
        <br>In 2004, another tragedy happened again. I lost my elder brother, Mabil Yuol. 
        <br>He was killed on his way to Malkal town to buy something for our family. We only received the news of his death. 
        <br>What was most painful is that we could not find his body to bury, and also, we didn't know who killed him so that one day we could revenge his death. 
        <br>We just buried his soul in our hearts and minds.
    </p>
    <p>A few years later, my sister got married, and we got some cattle as dowry. 
        <br>The living standard of our family improved because we could get enough food to feed us and sell the surplus to acquire what we did not have, such as clothes, guns, and salts.
        <br> Life ran smoothly for a few months until another horror-inducing incident happened once more. 
        <br>What can you do if the same people who took away your luck and left you without any hope for another life have come to take your luck away from you again?
        <br>It was a Thursday morning; the sun was shining brightly like a broken mirror, exposing its yellow-golden rays to the earth's atmosphere and then reflecting and revealing its beauty to the world. 
        <br>The weather was cool and fair. The earlier birds were singing their melodious songs.
        <br> As the wind was wrestling with trees, it was the morning that most to be remembered until the end of the world. 
        <br>As usual, we took our cattle to the same water point and grazing point.
        <br> As we were busy playing, one of my mates heard a gunshot and then reminded us to go home, but his plea fell on deaf ears. 
        <br>A moment later, the gunfire became clearer to us, but it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>Suddenly, we saw a very large group of men armed to the teeth running towards us and firing at us at the same time.
        <br> Our hearts skipped mighty beats and almost jerked out. Our eyes rolled in their sockets as we searched for a way to escape this horrifying incident. 
        <br>Some of us stood there as if they were planted there while sweat oozed from their bodies. 
        <br>Some of us took a clean piece of heel in whatever direction we thought would lead us to another breath. 
        <br>The Murle took our cattle, some of my mates, and even killed some people. They also burnt down our village. 
        <br>It was a very sad incident for those who escaped this death.
        <br> When I returned home, I saw everyone weeping bitterly and even tried to soothe their stomachs with a piece of clothes, indicating that something worse had happened.
        <br> It was another tragedy as my second brother, Hoth Yuol Nyuon, kicked the bucket in that horrible attack. 
        <br>It was very hard to cope with this situation, especially for my father, whose sons were dying one after another.</p>
    <p>Three months later, my father called me and told me that I would go to school to study. 
        <br>A week later, we started our journey together with my sister's children to Juba town. 
        <br>The journey was very long and tiresome because we had to walk on foot from Nyirol county to Bor town.
        <br> Moreover, the routes were very dangerous as one could be killed by wild animals like lions, and also, the Murle might attack and kill as well. 
        <br>Imagine the kids walking on foot, covering that long distance without any weapon to protect themselves from danger. 
        <br>We just walked, knowing that if there is a will, there is a way, and also prayed to God to protect us and give us strength to walk that distance. 
        <br>When we reached Panyaguot, we found some traders and explained our problems to them. 
        <br>They promised to take us to Kakuma camp. They paid for our transport. 
        <br>We arrived in the camp on sixteen July 2010 and registered as refugees on July 18, 2010. 
        <br>We were given a home to live in. On September 1, 2010, I enrolled as a pupil in Jebel Maara primary school.
        <br> Life in school and camp was not friendly compared to where I came from. 
        <br>First of all, Kakuma is too hot and dry. Secondly, it has many different people from different countries, tribes with different colors, unlike where I come from, where only people with dark complexions live, but I came to love it a lot.</p>
    <p>Here, we encountered many challenges such as shortages of stationery, food, and clothes.
        <br> We just depended on UNHCR for help. In 2016, I sat for my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education and scored 357 marks, but I did not get any scholarship.
        <br> This has not discouraged me from working hard, knowing that hard work pays.
        <br> On January 20, 2017, I enrolled in form one at Kakuma Refugee Secondary School. 
        <br>In form one, I put more effort and managed to be among the top ten students in all of form one.
        <br> I continued working hard, knowing that one day I would get a good grade and a scholarship. 
        <br>Unfortunately, I scored a mean grade that did not satisfy me, but I hope that one day, if I get a chance to join university, I will work hard to be among the students who are in the first class. 
        <br>In October 2021, I was awarded a scholarship by DAFI-Tertiary scholarship.
        <br> I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. 
        <br>I am in the second year, first semester."
        <br> I really thank the Almighty Father for his continue support!
